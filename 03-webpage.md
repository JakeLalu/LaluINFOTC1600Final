# Building a Simple Webpage

## Project Overview  
We'll build a webpage with a title, a heading, a paragraph, and some styling.

## Steps  
1. Create an `index.html` file and write basic HTML structure.  
2. Link a CSS file for styling.  
3. Use tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<link>` to structure and style your webpage.

## Example Code  
**HTML (index.html)**:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS (styles.css)**:  
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    color: #333;
}
h1 {
    color: #0066cc;
}
```
